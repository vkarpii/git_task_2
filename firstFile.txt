All my friends are heathens. Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don’t make any sudden moves
You don’t know the half of the abuse
//Git_1-second commit//Step 18 git_1 commit+push

All my friends are heathens. Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn’t mean our brains will change from hand grenades
